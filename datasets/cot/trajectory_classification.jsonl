The trajectory is generated by one of the following option: (1) car, (2) bike, (3) pedestrian. Please calculate the length and the average speed of the trajectory, and answer which option is most likely to generate this trajectory. Reasoning: The length of this trajectory is 72 meters and the duration is 38 seconds, thus the average speed is 1.89 m/s. Answer: The trajectory is most likely to be generated by ", "Answer": "(3) pedestrian."}
