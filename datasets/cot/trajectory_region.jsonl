Please answer which regions it has passed through in chronological order: 1) [2, 3], 2) [3], 3) [2], 4) [2, 5], 5) [5]. Answer only one option. Reasoning: The line connecting the first point and the second point in the trajectory does not pass through any region. The line connecting the second point and the third point in the trajectory passes through Region 2. The line connecting the third point and the fourth point in the trajectory passes through Region 2.
