GO AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nI first went to All Dental because I had a coupon which gave me X-rays and a cleaning for $89.  At the time, I didn't have insurance so I thought this would be a good deal.  I went in to the office, and the dental hygienist, Angelika, told me that my teeth were in such poor condition that I needed a full debridement instead of a regular cleaning and also told me that she recommended I get a fluoride treatment as well. I walked out that day spending close to $130, no where near the $89 I went in thinking I was going to pay.  \\n\\nI felt the hygienist did a great job cleaning my teeth, though, so when I received insurance with my new job, I called up All Dental to see if they covered my plan and they assured me that they were a covered provider with my plan.  I went in a few months later for my next cleaning, and the girl at the desk took my insurance card and verified my coverage.  She stated I would have a co-pay and that the rest would be covered by my insurance. I then had my teeth cleaned as usual.  \\n\\nI went again 6 months later, had my teeth cleaned again and thought everything was fine.  About a week after my 3rd cleaning, I received a statement from my provider stating that my claim from All Dental was denied.  I called up my provider to get to the bottom of the issue and they informed me that All Dental did not follow proper protocol of billing my claim for service through the Dentist (who was covered by my plan) but instead billed me through the dental hygienist, Angelika, who is not only not covered by my insurance, but also has no tax ID which makes it impossible for my insurance to accept it.  I called All Dental and they reassured me that they would fix the issue by re-submitting my claim through the proper procedure of billing through the dentist. \\n\\n I went back in for another cleaning a month later, thinking that everything had been resolved.  I went into the office, assured the girl at the desk that my insurance had not changed and proceeded into the dental office for a cleaning.   I sat down in the dental chair and the hygienist put the dental bib on me.  She then informed me that they had some new paperwork to go over with me since they recently changed dentists. As she was going over some of the paperwork, it dawned on me that my service today might not be covered due to the Dentist switch.    I proceeded to ask her why no one had informed me before I came in for my cleaning that they changed dentists.   I also told her I was worried the new dentist may not be covered by my plan.  Finally, I asked her if everything had finally been cleared up from a few months ago when my claim was denied from them.  \\n\\nThe hygienist looked visibly nervous and  assured me she would get to the bottom of everything right away.  She left me sitting in the dental chair, and closed the door.  I could hear hushed voices from the hallway.  That was when I started to realize that something shady was going on.  I called my provider immediately on the phone, stepped out into the hallway and told the office person to speak to my provider.  After they spoke, my provider informed me that the new dentist was in fact NOT covered by my insurance, and the previous claim that was supposed to have been re-submitted by the Dental Office under the contracted provider was never submitted.  I asked the dental office why they never re-submitted my claim and instead kept sending me bills to my home and they claimed it was because the previous Dentist had left and they had no way of submitting the claim under him.  I told them that if they wanted to get paid, they had better find a way, as I did not feel I was under any obligation to pay for a Dental Service when I was lied to and told my service would be covered.  I then walked out and haven't been back.  \\n\\nAnd to think after all the lying they have done, the fact that they let me walk back into that office and conveniently failed to tell me updated important information about my coverage as it relates to their business is abominable.  This place should be SHUT DOWN for lying to the public and giving misleading and wrong information.

Personally I found their consignment section, which has slightly used clubs you can purchase, to be of great value. I tested out a pair of (pre-owned) 52\\u00b0 wedges and purchased one for a very reasonable price. As for what exactly they have on the showroom floor (most big brands as well as some high end names), check out their website and/or Instagram.  \\n\\nWhen it's time to update your existing gear, the shop has the tools to fix your sticks or upgrade your style, too.  Personally I have had all my irons re-gripped here and they were helpful and picking out which brand & model worked best for my clubs.  Additionally they dissuaded me from revisions that I didn't need for my clubs which was totally appreciated.\\n\\nSolid place.

Owners seemed like nice guys but unorganized and lazy. Random clubs lying all over the place. I came in a week before I was leaving for a significant competitive golf tournament because one of my clubs had just broken and I needed it fixed before I left. They assured me that they would be able to get he job done with a couple days to spare even though they needed to order a necessary component that they didn't currently have in stock. I asked if they could give me a call when it was done and the guy laughed at me saying that he isn't organized enough to be able to do that. Atleast he was honest I guess. Anyways, I came in the next few days and each day they had a reason why the process of getting the part and the club fixed had to be pushed back a day and another and another eventually leading to me having to go to my tournament without what I needed. On top of this I had some extensions put in clubs that were done in a timely manner but one of them came loose so I had to bring it back in to be fixed. \\n\\nI completely understand that things happen and maybe this was just an isolated incident but not once did they apologize or show any signs of urgency to help me out when I had a specific time constraint even after they knew my situation and accepted the task.
